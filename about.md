Hi I'm Mike, currently working as a Software Engineer at Bardel Entertainment Inc.
I'm part of a small team developing software solutions to improve the performance
and stability of a CG production pipeline.

Before finding Computer Science I was working in public practice accounting.
Seeking a challenge, I decided to leave my position and go back to school.
At first, I found myself interested in Math and Physics but then discovered
Computer Science. I love the challenge it provides and the satisfaction
of building something.

While completing my undergraduate degree I was lucky enough to experience academic
research. I worked in a subfield of network theory called [graphlets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphlets).
This lead me to develop an application that can calculate various graphlet-based
network statistics. The program is still being used by some researchers at my old
university and I still tinker and improve the program when I have time to help out.
