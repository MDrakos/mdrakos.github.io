Hi I'm Mike Drakos, currently completing my final courses for a BSc.
in Computer Science at the University of Northern British Columbia in
Prince George, BC.

Before finding Computer Science I was working in professional accounting.
Seeking a challenge, I decided to leave my position and go back to school.
At first, I found myself interested in Math and Physics but then discovered
coding. I love the challenge is provides and the satisfaction of building
something.

Currently, I'm doing research on Graphlets for an undergraduate thesis and
I hope to continue my research after graduation.

Aside from school work and projects I'm passionate about web development
and spend my spare time learning as much as I can about it.
