Hi I'm Mike Drakos, currently completing my final courses for a BSc.
in Computer Science at the University of Northern British Columbia in
Prince George, BC.

Before finding Computer Science I was working in public practice accounting.
Seeking a challenge, I decided to leave my position and go back to school.
At first, I found myself interested in Math and Physics but then discovered
Computer Science. I love the challenge is provides and the satisfaction
of building something.

Currently, I'm doing research on [graphlets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphlets)
for an undergraduate thesis. For this research I'm developing an application
that can calculate the graphlet correlation distance between two networks.
Using this application I'm working with researchers from other fields
to determine if graphlet based network analysis can help them.
