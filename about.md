Hi I'm Mike. I am a 3rd year Computer Science student at UNBC in Prince George,
BC.

I am building this portfolio website as part of a project for CPSC 300 Software
Engineering.

Before finding Computer Science I was working in professional accounting. Originally,
I went back to school for Physics but quickly realized how much I enjoyed coding.
I hope to one day be a full time Software Developer.

I will be periodically updating this site as I add more projects to my
portfolio!

For now, here are some more cats!
