This website was created for CPSC 300 Software Engineering at UNBC. After playing
around with jekyll for a few hours I am starting to see the potential and I'm
looking forward to working more with it.

Hopefully I can say up to date with projects I push to my personal github and leave
my thoughts as I work away at them!
